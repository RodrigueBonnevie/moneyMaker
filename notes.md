# General 
  * Have a list of symbols that you want to look at.


# Portfolio
  * Make a class
  * This one takes in a list of symbols that it will trade on. 
  * Make it have a fixed amount of money
  * And have member functions that calls other functions such as moving average and such
  * You can have a ranking function also that returns a ranking metric on all stocks that it can buy fr

## portfolio implementation
  * Start with something that only trades one stock
  * It will always go all in on that stock if it has a buy signal
  * Must develop some kind of way to mock time in this implementation
    * either I have a paramteter in read data that makes it read to a certain point in time 

  * get data will have a start date and an end date, and to make this work we have be able to compare dates since there are dates missing in 
  * the data due to non working days.
